# AppointmentsManagementApp-v2.0-
MSSA Project 1: My first project as part of the MSSA program, I created a Windows Forms Application (C#). 
The application is an 'Appointment Management System', this application tracks a group of clients and its individual appointments. 

Functionality: The application starts with sample data, and the user, after a sussceful login, can add, delete and modify existing clients and individual appointments. 
Every login its recorded into a local text file.
               
Data Source: local variables, BindingLists, and Objects

Future improvements for version 2.0:
                                     *Implement a database for data source
                                     *More strict input validations
                                     *Possibly migrate to WPF (instead of Windows Forms) for a more flexible UI
                                     *Create a single dynamic form app (instead of multiple forms)
                                     *Would like to implement some sort of API service (TBD)
